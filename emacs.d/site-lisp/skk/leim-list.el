;;; Commentary:

;; This file registers SKK as input methods for Emacs.
;; Currently this file is for FSF Emacs only (not for XEmacs).

;;; Code:

(unless noninteractive
  ;; No need to load this file when Emacs is called for `make' or most of other
  ;; batch processings.

  ;; `register-input-method' is called in skk-autoloads.el.  `skk-activate' is
  ;; also autoloaded there.
  (require 'skk-autoloads)

  ;; Doubt.  This is a matter of preference.
  (require 'skk-setup))
